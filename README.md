# boilerplate-makefile
Very basic Makefile I use for small projects in C and C++

Keep in mind I didn't do any error checking (such as creating a directory if it doesn't exist), and if you want to use it, you need to either change the Makefile, or structure your project like I did in this repository.
However, I don't mind if anyone uses this as a starting point for their own Makefile, it is just something I felt like making.
